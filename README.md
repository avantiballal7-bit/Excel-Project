    Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of Business Analytics in Excel for project portfolio optimization. The objective is to select the most profitable combination of projects while staying within a fixed budget and satisfying multiple constraints.

Using Excel Solver (Binary Integer Programming), the model maximizes the Net Present Value (NPV) of selected projects subject to:

Budget limit of $10,000 million

Functional area requirements

Partnership considerations

Managerial allocation rules
